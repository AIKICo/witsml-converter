The "energyml" directory from the Energistics standards should be placed in this directory.

When the WITSML 1.4, 2.0, and 2.1 standard files are placed in this directory, these should be the paths from the repository root to the folders containing the XSD schemas for each standard:

WITSML 1.4: Mappings\Energistics\energyml\data\witsml\v1.4.1.1\xsd_schemas
WITSML 2.0: Mappings\Energistics\energyml\data\witsml\v2.0\xsd_schemas
WITSML 2.1: Mappings\Energistics\energyml\data\witsml\v2.1\xsd_schemas
